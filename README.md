#Smashing (under development)

Author: Karl Castillo<br/>

##Inspiration
Smashing is a template based on an already existing template called Bones (http://themble.com/bones/) and the Grid system BASE (http://matthewhartman.github.io/base/). Since Bones does not initially include BASE as its grid system, and I like base; I decided to incorporate BASE into Bones for future usage.

##Todo
- [ ] Change Images
- [ ] Add more features
- [ ] Incorporate Mnav into Smshing
